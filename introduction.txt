I do the homework for the first dataset that had 20 cities. It is easy to change the cities. 
in parameters.txt there is an analysis for each parameter.My analysis is also for the first dataset that had 20 cities. I ran the code for 1000 times and made average and best case for each parameter.
in algorithm.txt there is explanation for the algorithm. I also left some comments in TSP.py. 
run the code with python 2.
