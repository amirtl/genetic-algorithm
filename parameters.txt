we want to change one parameter at a time and see what will happens:

* NUMBER OF THE FIRST POPULATION
    - number of population = 20 (equals to the number of the cities):
        average fitness: 374
        average genarations: 1151
        best fitness: 278
        best genarations: 1019

    - number of population = 40 (twice the number of the cities):
        average fitness: 357
        average genarations: 1136
        best fitness: 275
        best genarations: 1010

    we can see that if increase the size of the first population we can get a better result.

* CHOOSE "N" PERCENT OF EACH GENERATION:
    - N = 50:
        average fitness: 373
        average genarations: 1146
        best fitness: 271
        best genarations: 1018
    - N = 25:
        average fitness: 401
        average genarations: 1310
        best fitness: 282
        best genarations: 1029

    from what we can see, when we decrease N it is not good all the time.

* WHEN WE STOP(STOP AFTER m TIMES THAT BEST FITNESS DIDN'T CHANGE:)
    - end_point = 100:
        average fitness: 324
        average genarations: 254
        best fitness: 264
        best genarations: 117
    - end_point = 1000:
        average fitness: 374
        average genarations: 1151
        best fitness: 271
        best genarations: 1018

    you can see that the stop point here is not important.

I think that it is really working randomly.
